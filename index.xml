      <description>Why do I have this site? While is slightly odd for a nobody like me to have a website, I don&amp;rsquo;t think it&amp;rsquo;s unusual to want some sort of canvas for self-expression.
Besides, this is a very cheap hobby. I use a free GitHub account and a domain name costing all of Â£5.
Regarding the blog specifically, see Orwell&amp;rsquo;s reasons for writing:
Sheer egoism. It goes without saying. Aesthetic enthusiasm. I think a blog is a good outlet for creativity.</description>

      <description>I wanted a place to talk about stuff that I like. If we have similar interests, you might enjoy something here.
P.S. you can&amp;rsquo;t use any of this for guessing my log-ins.
Books It&amp;rsquo;s quite hard for me to really make a good list encompassing all genres. So far, I&amp;rsquo;ve listed books in my main nerd fiction genres.
I find myself profoundly affected by recency bias when trying to think about other specific books to mention.</description>
