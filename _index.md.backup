Hi! My name is Dan. I currently manage the Westminster office of the Shadow Minister for Science, Research, and Innovation. This includes developing policy, strategy, and media, among other things.

Prior to this, I spent three years at the Department for Transport. I have a degree in Human, Social, and Political Sciences from the University of Cambridge.
