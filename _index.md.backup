Hi! My name is Dan. I'm a public servant and writer. 

This website hosts my blog, which I write for my own enjoyment more than anything else. I hope you enjoy your visit. If you know me personally, I'd be especially curious to hear what you think (unless you hate it).

My current work focuses on transport accessibility. I previously studied Human, Social, and Political Sciences at Clare College, University of Cambridge. If you want to discuss professional or academic questions, please find me on LinkedIn.
