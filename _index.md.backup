Hi! My name is Dan. I'm a researcher. My current work focuses on science policy, having made the leap from working on accessible travel at the Department for Transport.

I previously studied Human, Social, and Political Sciences at Clare College, University of Cambridge. If you want to discuss professional or academic questions, please find me on LinkedIn.
