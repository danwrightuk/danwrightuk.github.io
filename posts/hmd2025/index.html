  <div class="content"><p>I&rsquo;m writing this on Monday 3 February, having been awake for about 18 hours on little sleep, so this is unlikely to be my finest prose. However, I wanted to write down this stream of consciousness while my memories were still relatively fresh, rather than delay and let the imprints fade.</p>
<p>On Sunday 2 February 2025, I visited Auschwitz-Birkenau for the first time. Earlier in the week, we had marked the 80th anniversary of the liberation of the camp.</p>
<p>The Holocaust was a singularly evil and horrifying event. In recent years, I have visited museums and sites related to the Nazi regime in Nuremberg, Munich, Dachau, Berlin, Prague, and Vienna. I have no personal connection to the Holocaust but like all civilised people I find the accounts of the victims and the survivors extremely affecting and sobering.</p>
<p>Earlier in the year, I finished reading Arendt&rsquo;s account of the Eichmann trial, and I watched the film <em>A Real Pain</em> with a friend who shared her experience witnessing Auschwitz. I think this is what motivated me to book my flights after many years of wishing to visit.</p>
<p>I booked onto an English language tour with about 20 other people. About half seemed to be English, the rest from across Europe and the Anglophone countries. Our guide was a local Polish woman.</p>
<p>The tour begins in Auschwitz I. This site hosts permanent exhibitions of the appalling Nazi crimes. As our guide pointed out, we cannot picture over one million victims &ndash; but we can better imagine the owners of the mountains of shoes, hair, glasses, suitcases (including those with names and addresses) encased in glass.</p>
<p>The gallows; the Death Wall; the gas chamber and crematorium; the Hoess residence in the middle distance.</p>
<p>A shuttle bus transports us to Auschwitz-Birkenau. The scale of this camp was astonishing. Walking the length of the perimeter, with the smaller two gas chamber-crematorium buildings, I found the numbers of visitors were much less and the space for reflection a little larger. At the very edge, I saw a herd of deer.</p>
<p>Apart from the &ldquo;Arbeit Macht Frei&rdquo; sign in the first camp, the tracks, platform, and gatehouse are the most recognisable part of the camp. I found it useful to see these in real life to deconstruct the composite Auschwitz I knew from the screen and to understand the geography of this place as a real human settlement.</p>
<p>It being so close to the 80th anniversary ceremony, the gatehouse was actually encased in a giant white tent. According to our guide, this was so that the elderly Holocaust survivors could attend in the bracing Polish winter. It was in the process of being taken down.</p>
<p>The two largest gas chamber-crematorium complexes lie in ruin. Through these two great lungs of death at the head of the camp, hundreds of thousands of people were murdered &ndash; human life inhaled down the staircase and ash exhaled from the chimneys. I still don&rsquo;t think I can fully comprehend having walked the earth where 1.1 million people died.</p>
<p>The tour ended at the international monument, and a reflection by our guide on the importance of the site to keeping the memory alive. We were then able to walk the entirety of the camp and to leave when we chose to.</p>
<p>Next to one of the destroyed large gas chambers was a row of four tombstones (in Polish, English, and Hebrew). These were spread around the site, wherever ashes had been dumped and victims thus interred. In some cases, particularly near the smaller crematoriums, there were chilling photos showing groups of victims huddled in the woods prior to their murder by the Nazis, the same trees identifiable today.</p>
<p>The &ldquo;Kanada&rdquo; area of the camp housed the loot stolen from inmates. There is a section where, protected by a little glass hut, you can see possessions (buttons, cutlery, pots and the like) lying in the mud of one of the demolished buildings.</p>
<p>Balanced on top of this glasshouse, and, looking closely, on the foundations of certain old buildings, were buttons, shards of pottery, and even an old spoon. I assume these were found in the mud by other visitors. This section was not on the tour route, so relatively few people would have noticed this.</p>
<p>In a different way to the exhibitions behind glass, I found these loose possessions helped me to imagine a connection across the expanse of time to their former owners.</p>
<p>I walked one more time past the monument to the victims, which bears plaques in different languages bearing the same inscription. A group had been and placed electronic candles on most.</p>
<p>I will never forget the despondent faces of the young women I saw walking back from the area with the gas chamber ruins while my tour group was headed towards. Most of them were shrouded in Israeli flags.</p>
<p>As I approached the exit, I saw a building with a plaque that I hadn&rsquo;t read. For completeness sake, I doubled back to read it. It marked a building where Nazi physicians murdered newborns and their mothers with phenol injections to the heart.</p>
<hr>
<p>At first, I was surprised by the volume of photos being taken, as my instinct was to take in the surroundings without the distraction of photographing. However, I later came around to the view that documenting this site &ndash; and presumably sharing photos with friends and family &ndash; as much as possible was the right thing to do to spread the word.</p>
<p>While I could take as much time as I wanted in Auschwitz-Birkenau after the tour, our time in Auschwitz I was limited. I understand that this is to support the museum to pass a large volume of people through the site, but I am someone who would&rsquo;ve liked to stop and reflect for longer at certain points. I&rsquo;m sure this could be accommodated through other ways of visiting.</p>
<p>The vast majority of guests I saw were respectful. I have never been able to understand people who crack jokes or mess about at sites like this, but to each their own.</p>
<p>Auschwitz receives a huge volume of visitors, even in the winter. That&rsquo;s good. I was reminded of the ending of <em>The Zone of Interest</em>, which I suddenly feel like watching again.</p>
<hr>
<p>As a final note, Krakow is a wonderful city and I hope to return to Poland soon.</p>
