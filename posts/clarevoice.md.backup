After I graduated in 2020, I was asked to provide an article for the <i?Clare Review</i>. I recently found a copy online while looking for something else. For posterity, I reproduce the following from said [online version](https://stories.clare.cam.ac.uk/student-voice/), which also features the excellent Jonty Townson and some nostalgic photos.

UCS President</h1>

As the outgoing UCS president and a recent graduate, my final year at Clare was one of my best; for obvious reasons, it was also one of the worst. Allow me to take you through my year – both ‘at Clare’, and far away from it, too. We started the year in traditional style. For the UCS, Freshers’ Week was the usual blur of talks, events, car-park Tetris, and beautifully ordered chaos. The spirited UCS committee, Clare staff, and Natalie Chapman’s excellent planning in particular deserve credit for the week’s success.

That term, the UCS did a lot of cool things. We launched Cambridge’s first Gender Expression Fund to help transgender students. We supported students through strike action. And we hosted great social and welfare events, including a ‘Yellow Week’ for welfare (which, being entirely online, was ahead of its time).

Truthfully, I can think of too many highlights to include here. Whether we met in the grandeur of Old Court or the darkest depths of the Colony Computer Room, I have fond memories of the UCS and the great things my committee members achieved. We went into 2020 in good spirits. ‘Yellow Week’ made its triumphant real-world debut, and we held a ‘Green Week’ to promote environmentalism. We even hosted visitors from our sister college for a sports day. Unfortunately for us, we lost most of the events; unfortunately for them, they had to go back to Oxford.

In a memorably surreal moment, spurred on by promises of free pizza and a karaoke machine for Cellars, the whole College rallied together to win CUSU’s election turnout competition. Sadly, we never enjoyed the fruits of our labour.

I expected Brexit to be the defining event of Lent term, but we all know what happened next. The newly elected UCS suddenly had a lot on its plate. Clare shut up shop and students, myself included, went home for good.

Like many, I found studying during lockdown immensely difficult. I’m grateful for the support of my tutor and Director of Studies who together ensured I had a good workspace.

I was delighted I could advise Rosa [Martin, current UCS President] and the new committee on things as diverse as accommodation and a 24-hour charity livestream for the NHS. Our live-streamed rendering of Memorial Court in Minecraft won’t win any awards, but the stream showcased Clare’s creativity and community spirit. Later on, it was an honour to help the College with our virtual graduation ceremony.

I returned in June to move my things out of Clare. I was able to enjoy half an hour of summer sunshine with my dad on the balcony of my Colony room. Having missed out on my final term at Cambridge, and all it was meant to be, it was a bittersweet moment.

Even with the scaffolding and social distancing, I hope every current student makes the most of their time at Clare. It’s a special community that I will always treasure. Good luck everyone –staff, students, Fellows and alumni – for the year ahead.

Look after each other.
