![National COVID Memorial Wall](/covid.jpg)

I want to pay tribute to the National COVID Memorial Wall. Today was its second anniversary, and I visited by chance during a break from the office.

Despite walking that stretch of the Thames quite often, the wall never fails to move me. It's a supremely poignant monument to the devastation that COVID-19 caused, or was allowed to cause, in the UK. The simple act of walking the path provides the time to reflect on those days and the lives we lost (literally and figuratively).

The painted hearts themselves are striking, but today volunteers had also adorned the embankment with photos of the victims. We should all be so lucky to be survived by people so dedicated to keeping our memories alive.

Unlike any other great memorial I have had the privilege to visit -- marking historical tragedies like the Holocaust or 9/11 -- this one evokes vivid first-hand memories. I am very fortunate that no one I know ended up with a heart on the wall; we paid lesser prices and carry the marks of the pandemic with us instead.

I hope our generation will speak frankly about COVID in years to come, but I'm grateful that this memorial provides space for private reflection. Please visit the next time you're in the area.
