I know that the following will probably come across as sentimental nonsense to anyone in their normal state of mind. This passing difference in perspective is a quite like that between dispassionately studying WW1 on the one hand, and attending an Armistice Day service on the other. Regardless, I think I'll upload this and accept that I can cringe at my own sincerity.

Today was the second anniversary of the National COVID Memorial Wall, and I visited by chance during a break from the office.

Despite the fact that I walk that stretch of the river fairly often, the memorial does still affect me. It's a poignant monument to the devastation that COVID-19 caused, and was allowed to cause, in the UK. Walking the path provides the time to reflect on those days and the lives we lost.

For the anniversary, volunteers had adorned the embankment with photos of the victims above the hearts. To be frank, we should all be so lucky to be survived by people so dedicated to keeping our memories alive.

Unlike any other great memorial I have had the privilege to visit -- marking historical tragedies like the Holocaust or 9/11 -- this one evokes vivid first-hand memories. I am very fortunate that no one I know ended up with a heart on the wall. We paid lesser prices and live with the marks of the pandemic instead.

I know our generation will speak frankly about COVID in years to come, but I'm grateful that this memorial provides space for private reflection. It's worth a quiet visit.
