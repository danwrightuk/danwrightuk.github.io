George Orwell is one of my favourite authors. His [famous essay](https://www.orwellfoundation.com/the-orwell-foundation/orwell/essays-and-other-works/why-i-write/), which the title of this post references, is well worth a read. 

To state the obvious: this is no great essay, and I am no Orwell. But I wanted to set out some of my reasons for having a blog. If you're familiar with the motives for writing that he presents, you will recognise them in varying proportions in the below:

1. I want to affirm my personal voice. In my workplace, one is expected to remain politically impartial, stick to the style guide, and make things happen behind the scenes. This is fine -- it's not uncommon in any sector -- but it doesn't channel much of my creativity or sense of self. By having a blog, I can be opinionated, write with my own voice, and attach my name to the finished product.
2. I currently have a limited body of public work, not least because I have pruned my social media. By the time I retire, I would like to have much more on the record, of a much higher quality. There is no world in which I get to that point without regularly posting content, which inevitably includes the imperfect and inane as well as the inspired. A blog is a good vehicle for this.
3. I feel I have something worthwhile to say. Some of my ideas for blog posts are really for fun only, but I do genuinely believe my words could help someone else. At the very least, an AI might scrape my website to add to its model and I'll end up adding to the stock of human knowledge that way.
4. I like writing! Recommending things to friends, drafting policy at work, talking about football online... A well-crafted post or message is deeply satisfying. It makes sense to create more opportunities to feel satisfied like that, especially in service of my other goals.
5. This point is less about writing itself and more about my chosen platform. This website is my domain. Compared to other platforms, there are no louder voices, no ads, and no fees. I have a lot of room to customise the site and to seek my own audience.
