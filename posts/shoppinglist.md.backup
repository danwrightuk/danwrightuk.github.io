Inspired by [*Consumer Surplus*](https://www.sambowman.co), I thought it would be fun to suggest some things that I think add significant value to my life.

# Health

## Omega 3

I eat a vegetarian diet 99% of the time, so while I get a lot of Omega 3 ALA from olive oil (which I cook with exclusively) and nuts, I like to supplement algae oil to maintain the proper ratios of EPA and DHA too. Many vegan supplements only have DHA but [this brand](https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B09XMRVRVZ/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&th=1) has both as well as antioxidant astaxanthin.

## Vitamin D

Autumn/winter are my favourite seasons. To enjoy them to their fullest in our blessed UK climate, I follow the [public health advice](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/vitamins-and-minerals/vitamin-d/) to supplement Vitamin D. It's quite cheap at any supermarket and better than deficiency. 

## Tretinoin

Tretinoin is my [retinoid](https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B07XJQZKL2/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&th=1) of choice as it ticks the boxes I think I need: anti-acne (I have bad skin), anti-hyperpigmentation (I have scars from bad skin), and anti-ageing (we are all getting older). 

I order from All Day Chemist online, which is much cheaper than any UK-based prescriber because it ships the generic brands readily available abroad. I spent $20 with $20 shipping for 3 tubes of Retin-A 0.025% that should last years; one month of Dermatica costs £24.99.

## Hydrocolloid Patches

These sometimes work incredibly well to get rid of spots quickly, and that's all I can ask -- they're better than nothing. [This brand](https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B07G1VKCND/) is what I have currently.

# Kitchen

## Rice Cooker
 
Making rice in a pan is annoying. A rice cooker with a decent capacity (ours is about 1 litre) can change your life. Often they'll work for porridge too but I don't make it that way.

If I get home from work and have nothing lined up, I'll often do a one pot rice cooker meal -- white or brown rice, cook, towards the end add frozen peas and kidney beans, spices, soy sauce, extra virgin olive oil, seasoning -- which is done with a minimum of effort in 40 minutes. 

I use my flatmate's Tefal model from Hong Kong. I donated my [Lakeland one](https://www.lakeland.co.uk/62569/lakeland-2-portion-mini-electric-rice-cooker) to my mum. It's good, but for the price it is now (£45) you could perhaps get a larger one.

## Stainless Steel Pan

I enjoy having a frying pan that you can put into the oven and the dishwasher. I own this make from [Kuhn Rikon](https://www.kuhnrikon.co.uk/all-round-frying-pan-2) which I bought from Bradbeers in Salisbury for less than the online price. For eggs, I'd probably still use non-stick to avoid the hassle.

I'm interested in cast iron, which you can make non-stick with some work, but I'm doubtful I'd use it enough to justify even a £20 model.

## Bamboo Chopping Board

Something about the knife-cut grooves on the plastic boards gets under my skin. I decided it was worth the switch for the sake of my knives and my body to buy a bamboo chopping board. They're under £7 at [Tesco](https://www.tesco.com/groceries/en-GB/products/303676888).

## Glass Food Storage

[IKEA's glass containers](https://www.ikea.com/gb/en/p/ikea-365--food-container-with-lid-square-glass-plastic-s39269120/) are strong, dishwasher safe, and can go straight from fridge/freezer to microwave without any damage. I use the plastic lids now since I usually keep runny dishes like leftover chilli, but you can get bamboo lids too.

# Home

## Dehumidifier

Dehumidifiers are really helpful in modern Britain (i.e. heating is expensive and you need to avoid mould somehow).

Without the dehumidifier, relative humidity reaches 65-75% in my flat when trying to dry laundry. The dehumidifier cuts this to 50% and I can use the water for my plants. 

I wouldn't waste money on some low-capacity, no-name brand from Amazon. Meaco came out ahead in my research and I would recommend their [ABC range](https://www.meaco.com/products/meaco-meacodry-dehumidifier-abc-range-10l). 

# Life

## Library Membership

Public libraries offer such an amazing range of services for **free**. Request new releases and chances are they'll get them for you too.

## Safety Razor

I bought this [safety razor](https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B07XJQZKL2/) in 2021 and found it so much better to shave with than my plastic cartridge razors. It's also more environmentally friendly (blades are recyclable).

## Glass Bottle

[Chilly's bottles](https://www.chillys.com/) are great and I will likely get a new one soon (I left my previous one at airport security). But I've been pleasantly surprised by how easy it is to reuse a [BOL power shake bottle](https://www.tesco.com/groceries/en-GB/products/310140884).

For £2.50, including a nice vegan milkshake, it has yet to shatter on me and can be cleaned in the dishwasher, which is far more convenient than insulated stainless steel bottles.
