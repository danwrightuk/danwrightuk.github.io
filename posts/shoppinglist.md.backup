Inspired by [*Consumer Surplus*](https://www.sambowman.co), I thought it would be fun to suggest some economical things that I think add significant value to my life.

I know this is quite weird, but at the same time, I find it interesting to learn from other people's experiences so I figured I shou as well share my own. Personal finance is one case where I've definitely benefited from the research done by others.

# Life

## Library Membership

Public libraries offer an amazing range of services for **free**. Request new releases and chances are they'll get them for you too. The thing is, you need to learn to share; I asked mine for [The Blazing World](https://www.bloomsbury.com/uk/blazing-world-9781526621672/) but have yet to read it as someone else got in there first.

## Password Manager

I won't say which service I use, but a good password manager is well worth the money for the security and peace of mind. To me, this is the epitome of good value for money.

## VPN

Some YouTuber, somewhere, is being sponsored by NordVPN or Surfshark to where you can get a year or two for basically nothing. If you're going to use a network or website anyway that you consider to be at all dodgy, you might as well use a VPN.

# Kitchen

## Rice Cooker
 
One of the most underrated modern conveniences. If I get home from work and have nothing planned, I can do a one pot rice cooker meal -- white or brown rice, towards the end add frozen peas and kidney beans, spices, soy sauce, extra virgin olive oil, spring onion -- which is done with a minimum of effort in 45 minutes. 

I use my flatmate's Tefal model from Hong Kong. I had a [Lakeland model](https://www.lakeland.co.uk/62569/lakeland-2-portion-mini-electric-rice-cooker) which I gave to someone else; for the price it is now (£45) you could perhaps get a larger one.

## Stainless Steel Pan

Realistically, I bought one because my favourite food YouTuber uses them, but they are useful for being oven and dishwasher safe. I own this make from [Kuhn Rikon](https://www.kuhnrikon.co.uk/all-round-frying-pan-2) which I bought from Bradbeers in Salisbury (virtue signalling about how I support the high street).

## Bamboo Chopping Board

Do grooves left by knives on plastic cutting boards suggest microplastics are winding up in your food? I'm not sure but I decided I'd buy a bamboo chopping board just in case. They're literally under £7 at [Tesco](https://www.tesco.com/groceries/en-GB/products/303676888).

## Glass Food Storage

[IKEA's glass containers](https://www.ikea.com/gb/en/p/ikea-365--food-container-with-lid-square-glass-plastic-s39269120/) are strong, dishwasher safe, and can go straight from fridge/freezer to microwave without any damage. I use the plastic lids now since I usually keep runny dishes like leftover chilli, but you can get bamboo lids too.

# Home

## Dehumidifier

Dehumidifiers are really helpful in modern Britain (i.e. heating is expensive but you need to avoid mould somehow). I like lüften but opening the windows for long stretches (e.)

Without the dehumidifier, relative humidity reaches 65-75% in my flat. The dehumidifier cuts this to 50% and I can use the water for my plants. 

I wouldn't waste money on a low-capacity, no-name brand from Amazon. Meaco came out ahead in my research and I would recommend their [ABC range](https://www.meaco.com/products/meaco-meacodry-dehumidifier-abc-range-10l). 

## Air Purifier

Living near a big road in London, having my air purifier -- a [Levoit Core 300S](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Levoit-Smart-Purifier-Core-300S/dp/B08L73QL1V/), which is powerful enough for my room -- reassures me that I am doing something to limit the effects of toxic air getting into my home. Outside the home, we need a political solution...

# Health

## Omega 3

For people who attempt vegetarianism/veganism, it's worth supplementing DHA/ELA Many vegan supplements only have DHA. [This brand](https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B09XMRVRVZ/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&th=1) has both as well as antioxidant astaxanthin.

## Vitamin D

Besides Omega 3, Vitamin D is the only other thing I consider it worthwhile supplementing regularly and one of the few things the [NHS](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/vitamins-and-minerals/vitamin-d/) recommends. 

## Tretinoin

For whatever reason I suffer adult acne -- an unsympathetic and unsexy problem to have -- so tretinoin is my [retinoid](https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B07XJQZKL2/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&th=1) of choice.

I order from All Day Chemist online, which is much cheaper than any UK-based prescriber because it ships the generic brands available abroad.
