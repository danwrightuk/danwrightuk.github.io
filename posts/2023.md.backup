Some quick reflections on my 2023. All are personal, but the first three err on the side of the professional.

1. I improved my well-being this year significantly by building more positive interactions into my basic lifestyle (e.g. walking to work, living with friendly flatmates, working in a social office). This is blindingly obvious, but you do need to seek those opportunities out as they aren't a given. In the Civil Service, I usually worked from home three days out of five because my colleagues would go in two days a week -- and 90% of a day in the office could be spent apart from colleagues due to hot-desking. Right now, I wouldn't go back to that.
2. I took the next step in my career by being resilient and keeping an open mind. I had an offer to go back to Cambridge to study the Public Policy MPhil which, as a taught postgraduate masters, is very expensive (~Â£50k). Having lost my final undergrad term to COVID in 2020, and finding myself dissatisfied with work, it was not emotionally easy to decline that offer for affordability reasons. But I was able to take steps to act on my initial rationale for applying -- a different career trajectory -- by being more open-minded about the jobs I could be applying for. 
3. On a similar note, one of my favourite moments from *Oppenheimer*:

	>Edward Condon: Why would we move out to the middle of the desert for two to three years?
    
    >Leslie Groves: Why? How about because this is the most important fucking thing to ever happen in the history of the world!
    
    Obviously that's quite over the top for almost everyone -- maybe people developing AGI could claim that mantle -- but I've been reminded this year how motivating it is when work feels both important and challenging.
4. Cognitive behavioural therapy works... This brave and unique realisation came after several years of not pursuing treatment for OCD, for various reasons. Therapy gave me the tools to manage OCD in ways that won't reinforce the underlying problem. The NHS wait-lists are far too long, but if you think you could benefit, I would recommend self-referring to your local service and seeing what comes from it.
5. Cooking good/nutritious food is its own reward. I still live frugally but I've levelled up my culinary skills dramatically. I like relaxing with YouTube and you can do a lot worse for infotainment than home cooking channels like [Adam Ragusea](https://www.youtube.com/@aragusea).
6. Learn to let go. I spent a lot of time earlier in the year worrying about balding. Giving myself buzz cuts means I now only spend *some* time worrying about balding. It's something!
