To save myself grief, and for the avoidance of doubt, everything in this post relates to my experiences and opinions only. These are my views -- certainly not those of past or present employers, nor past or present colleagues.

I spent three years in the Civil Service. This was an eye-opening experience of government which I really did enjoy.

It was precisely because I spent those years in the Civil Service that I was unsurprised to see the news of a collapse in Civil Service Fast Stream applications. The Conservatives have done absolutely nothing to maintain its appeal.

In financial terms, it's a good deal, but not necessarily best in class. You have to jump through plenty of hoops to get onto the Fast Stream, like you do for other grad schemes, but your reward is two years of sub-HEO (London weighted) pay which has been eroded in real terms by years of public sector pay restraint.

In comparison, the supermarket schemes generally pay more with much better benefits, barring the Civil Service pension -- to say nothing of schemes in finance, law, consultancy, and so on. Or, if you're an active enough person to have good behaviour examples already, you could enter at HEO directly and enjoy the higher starting salary.

If you're more inclined towards public service or the third sector over business, the Fast Stream still has some appeal. But it's hard to ignore the toxicity that the Tories and their sympathetic press have cultivated around the Civil Service.

I think most of my ex-colleagues would recall [Peloton-gate](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-58804607) in late 2021, or [JRM's notes](https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/apr/23/condescending-jacob-rees-mogg-leaves-notes-for-wfh-civil-servants) in early 2022. Nowadays, there's the war on ["woke"](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/politics/2024/01/20/crackdown-on-activists-in-the-civil-service/) and the Deputy PM's AI ["hit squads"](https://www.ft.com/content/a959cd2b-eb1e-4289-92d6-81a7bf6a0bcf).

Has the Fast Stream's target audience really been given the best pitch by the government?

Of course, many people see through the bullshit and want to be top public servants anyway. And at the end of the Fast Stream process, you have a clear shot at G7 -- probably better than your median direct entry person would have -- and G7 is still good money. 

But I wouldn't be surprised to find a growing awareness online that you can get to a senior position in government through other routes. This could be by entering directly at HEO and working your way up the ranks, or, with current focus on recruiting externally, by making better money in business and then entering as a G7 or higher. So why go through the trouble of the Fast Stream?

For my two cents, I would recommend the Fast Stream on the same basis that I'd recommend direct entry as HEO or SEO. The Civil Service is still a fantastic place to work. But I'd struggle to make a strong case for the Fast Stream especially. That feels like a problem to solve.
