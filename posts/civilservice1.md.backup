To save myself grief, and for the avoidance of doubt, everything in this post relates to my experiences and opinions only. These are my views -- certainly not those of past or present employers, nor past or present colleagues.

Prior to working for an MP, I spent three years in the Civil Service. This was an eye-opening experience of government and something I would recommend to any public-spirited, thoughtful person looking for a meaningful line of work. 

Since leaving, I've happily shared my views on the Civil Service with new colleagues. However, unlike my Civil Service pension -- which is perfect and evergreen -- my memories of my time there become a little worse with each passing month, so I wanted to commit some of them to posterity.

## Experience

[Keir Starmer's speech](https://labourlist.org/2024/01/read-watch-keir-starmer-full-speech-civil-society-today/) about government and civil society struck a particular chord with me and inspired this quick post today on the subject of respect.

"In its desperation to cling onto power at all costs, the Tory Party is undertaking a kind of weird McCarthyism, trying to find woke agendas in the very civic institutions they once regarded with respect."

The Conservatives' beef with the National Trust or RNLI feels like an outgrowth of the same mentality that brought some Tory ministers into sharper conflict with the Civil Service.

The period 2020-2023, during which I worked in the Department for Transport, saw a gradual souring of minister-Civil Service relations. Historians will find evidence of this happening across the Civil Service (online see /r/CivilService, CivilServiceWorld, media, the first draft of history).

Former colleagues seemed most affected by:

1. A sudden, mandated return-to-office after COVID-19, which many objected to on the grounds of inadequate consultation and poor justification. This seemed out of step with the private sector.
2. In relation to #1, hostile, absurd briefing about civil servants by ministers to the press or in public. Examples which had particular sticking power with my ex-colleagues were [Peloton-gate](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-58804607) in late 2021, [JRM's notes](https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/apr/23/condescending-jacob-rees-mogg-leaves-notes-for-wfh-civil-servants) in early 2022, or the ongoing war on ["woke"](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/politics/2024/01/20/crackdown-on-activists-in-the-civil-service/) workplace equality, diversity, and inclusion.
3. In relation to #2, a perception that Perm-Sec level Senior Civil Servants -- the only ones able to command media attention -- did not adequately stick up for staff or defend the Civil Service's reputation. There were [some examples](https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2023/aug/14/ministers-attacks-on-civil-servants-damaged-whitehall-staff-retention) but certainly I found general dissatisfaction with our most senior officials' handling of the matter.

All of this occurred against a backdrop of years of zero or very low pay rises, which added to a feeling of being undervalued by ministers and poorly represented by senior leaders. This feeling was particularly bitter for officials who had delivered for ministers through significant adversity and ambiguity, not only during COVID-19 but also the preparations for Brexit. 

In this environment, I was not surprised that the strikes of summer 2023 managed to pass the turnover threshold.

## Lessons

Treating your workforce well is an end in itself. But the actions of the government were so obviously counterproductive from my perspective.

The vast majority of my ex-colleagues had the customary goodwill expected of public servants, and all stuck to the Civil Service code. Their irritation was that ministers were not upholding their end of the deal: to be, as convention requires, respectful of the Civil Service and its *de facto* autonomy as a modern employer/workplace.

This [article]((https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2023/aug/14/ministers-attacks-on-civil-servants-damaged-whitehall-staff-retention)) mentions worsening morale as well as higher turnover. I know no one who downed tools over this stuff, but I know it did nothing to win over sceptics of things like the "return to office" mandate. Nor did it help organisations to figure out the best way to implement it. On the contrary, the culture ministers created made compliance less likely and discussions about the subject more divisive.

All parties wish to see a higher performing Civil Service and to boost productivity with technology like LLMs. Inevitably, it seems to me that one precondition of this process happening *constructively* (and therefore, with less resistance, more *efficiently*) will be to rebuild the relationships between ministers and civil servants. 

Given that many junior (and lower-grade senior) civil servants have little to no "relationship" with their ministers, beyond submissions and a few meetings, it's perhaps more accurate to say that the challenge is to rehabilitate the reputation of ministers with civil servants.

The culture of the Civil Service will make people receptive to such efforts. Indeed, despite what the press might suggest, I found that new Tory ministers always received a fair hearing. Shortly before I left, Mark Harper promised staff a better working relationship, and the strikes had won a better pay deal. I have no doubt that incoming Labour ministers would be judged on their merits too.

There will be inevitably be times when pay restraint or reform agendas lead to conflict between governments and civil servants. But I think any government would do well to have fewer ["hit squads"](https://www.ft.com/content/a959cd2b-eb1e-4289-92d6-81a7bf6a0bcf), and more respectful cooperation towards the common goal: advancing the welfare of citizens.
