To save myself grief, and for the avoidance of doubt, everything in this post relates to my experiences and opinions only. These are my views -- certainly not those of past or present employers, nor past or present colleagues.

Prior to working for an MP, I spent three years in the Civil Service. This was an eye-opening experience of government and something I would recommend to any public-spirited, thoughtful person looking for a meaningful line of work. 

Since leaving, I've happily shared my views on the Civil Service with new colleagues. However, unlike my Civil Service pension -- which is perfect and evergreen -- my memories become a little hazier with each passing month, so I wanted to commit some of them to posterity.

## Experience

[Keir Starmer's speech](https://labourlist.org/2024/01/read-watch-keir-starmer-full-speech-civil-society-today/) about government and civil society struck a particular chord with me and inspired this quick post today on the subject of respect.

"In its desperation to cling onto power at all costs, the Tory Party is undertaking a kind of weird McCarthyism, trying to find woke agendas in the very civic institutions they once regarded with respect."

The Conservatives' beef with the National Trust or RNLI feels like an outgrowth of the same mentality that brought some Tory ministers into sharper conflict with the Civil Service.

The period 2021-2023, during which I worked in the Department for Transport, saw a gradual souring of minister-Civil Service relations. Historians will record plenty of evidence of this happening across the Civil Service (online see /r/CivilService, CivilServiceWorld, media reports).

Ex-colleagues seemed most affected by:

1. A mandated return-to-office after COVID-19, which many objected to on the grounds of inadequate consultation and poor justification.
2. In relation to #1, hostile, absurd briefing about civil servants by ministers to the press or in public. Examples which had particular sticking power with my ex-colleagues were [Peloton-gate](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-58804607) in late 2021, [JRM's notes](https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/apr/23/condescending-jacob-rees-mogg-leaves-notes-for-wfh-civil-servants) in early 2022, or the ongoing war on ["woke"](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/politics/2024/01/20/crackdown-on-activists-in-the-civil-service/) workplace equality, diversity, and inclusion.
3. In relation to #2, a perception that Perm-Sec level Senior Civil Servants -- the only ones able to command media attention -- did not adequately stick up for staff or defend the Civil Service's reputation. There were [some examples](https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2023/aug/14/ministers-attacks-on-civil-servants-damaged-whitehall-staff-retention) but certainly I found general dissatisfaction with our most senior officials' handling of the matter.

All of this occurred against a backdrop of years of zero or very low pay rises, which added to a feeling of being undervalued by ministers and poorly represented by the upper echelons. This felt particularly bitter for officials who had worked through unprecedented challenges like COVID-19 or the logistics of Brexit. 

In this environment, I was not surprised that the strikes of summer 2023 managed to pass the turnover threshold.

## Lessons

Briefly, in terms of consequences, the article above mentions poorer morale, which I did observe from my corner of the organisation, and higher [turnover](https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2023/aug/14/ministers-attacks-on-civil-servants-damaged-whitehall-staff-retention).

As well as the obvious moral/ethical issues of demeaning one's workers, the most significant effect I saw at junior grades was that it made some people less likely to comply with directives like minimum office attendance and more likely to support strike action.

I do believe we need to achieve higher performance in the Civil Service to maximise the opportunities of mission-led government. Inevitably, it seems to me that one precondition of this process happening *constructively* (and therefore, with less resistance, more *efficiently*) will be to rebuild the relationships between ministers and civil servants. 

Given that many junior (and lower-grade senior) civil servants have little to no "relationship" with their ministers, beyond submissions and a few meetings, it's perhaps more accurate to say that the challenge is to rehabilitate the reputation of ministers with civil servants.

Fortunately for new ministers, I do believe that the Whitehall Civil Service start from a position of goodwill. Most of my ex-colleagues had this spirit and all kept to expectations of the Civil Service Code. The irritation was that ministers were not upholding their end - i.e. to be, by convention, respectful of the Civil Service and its role.

Indeed, despite what the press might suggest, I found that new Tory ministers always received a fair hearing. Shortly before I left, Mark Harper promised staff a better working relationship and the strikes had won a better pay deal. I have no doubt that incoming Labour ministers would be judged on their merits too.

All that besides, career civil servants rely on ministers to do their job well (and vice versa), which are incentives that overpower pettier concerns. Whether you *like* a minister or not, you must do your duty.

There will be times when pay restraint or reform agendas lead to conflict between the government of the day and civil servants. But any government would do well to have fewer ["hit squads"](https://www.ft.com/content/a959cd2b-eb1e-4289-92d6-81a7bf6a0bcf), and more respectful cooperation towards the common goal: better outcomes for citizens.
