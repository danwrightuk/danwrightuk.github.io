      <description>Inspired by Consumer Surplus, I thought it would be fun to suggest some things that I think add significant value to my life.
Health Omega 3 I eat a vegetarian diet 99% of the time, so while I get a lot of Omega 3 ALA from olive oil (which I cook with exclusively) and nuts, I like to supplement algae oil to maintain the proper ratios of EPA and DHA too.</description>

      <description>Here&amp;rsquo;s some books or articles I&amp;rsquo;d recommend. I can&amp;rsquo;t claim this list is some sort of cohesive narrative, but I&amp;rsquo;d say all of these have something of merit regardless of political persuasion. I will add to this.
Politics The Art of War, Sun Tzu.
The History of the Peloponnesian War, Thucydides.
Leviathan, Thomas Hobbes.
The Putney Debates. I got a copy in one of the Verso sales. We forget our democratic and republican history in this country.</description>
