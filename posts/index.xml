      <description>I wanted to set out my rationale for having a blog. George Orwell once gave four motives for writing, present in every writer in varying proportions:
Sheer egoism. Aesthetic enthusiasm. Historical impulse. Political purpose. My current motivations are a mix of 1, 2, and 4. In my own words, I would codify them as:
By the time I shuffle off this mortal coil, I would like to have some words on the record, regardless of the number of people who substantially care or remember them &amp;ndash; though I obviously hope it will more than zero.</description>

      <description>Inspired by Consumer Surplus, I thought it would be fun to suggest some economical things that I think add significant value to my life.
I know this is quite weird, but at the same time, I find it interesting to learn from other people&amp;rsquo;s experiences so I figured I might as well share my own. Personal finance is one case where I&amp;rsquo;ve definitely benefited from the research done by others.</description>

      <title>Reading List</title>

      <description>Here&amp;rsquo;s some books or articles I&amp;rsquo;d recommend. I can&amp;rsquo;t claim this list is some sort of cohesive narrative, but I&amp;rsquo;d say all of these have something of merit regardless of political persuasion. I will add to this.
Keep in mind that because I would like to have a job, this is not an exhaustive list of everything I consider worthwhile reading.
Politics The Art of War, Sun Tzu.
The History of the Peloponnesian War, Thucydides.</description>
