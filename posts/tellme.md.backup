Some things I wish I'd been told earlier in my adult life:

1. Start exercising sooner. The time will pass anyway.
2. Save and invest religiously. Thank you [ukpersonal.finance](ukpersonal.finance).
3. Check where your (DC) pension is invested. I hate to think how much money it would have cost me to stay on the terrible default option for longer.
4. Get a credit card. You can catch up quickly but I think I may have lived with less stress having a line of credit sooner.
5. Buy things that are portable, where possible. As a renter, it will make life easier. This is less important if you have reliable access to a car.
6. Postgraduate education in the UK costs more than you'd think. Anecdotally, more people regret it than you'd think.
7. Improve privacy and security before surrendering more years of data. There are easy guides like [thenewoil.org](thenewoil.org).
