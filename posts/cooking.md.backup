Many friends report a lack of confidence in their culinary abilities. I, myself, am no Michelin star chef, but I've watched enough cooking content to have gathered some conventional wisdom about how to make food taste better easily.

Thank you to [Adam Ragusea](https://www.youtube.com/@aragusea) and [Chef John from Food Wishes](https://www.youtube.com/@foodwishes) for my education.

# Attitudes

Three things really helped me to be more expressive. 

Firstly, abandoning any aspiration for "tradition" or "authenticity". I appreciate that as an Englishman, in England, my mindset here may differ from diasporic individuals looking to keep their cultural flame alive. I copy some aspects of traditional English cooking from my mum.

Ultimately, however, I think it's counterproductive as a modest chef to try to perfectly copy a "traditional" recipe -- particularly since any recipe itself will be iterative and contingent. Putting spins on food to suit your tastes is absolutely fine.

Secondly, recognising the common building blocks. I think if you've read enough recipes that, for example, have you frying an onion, garlic, and pepper, you can accept that you can't go too far wrong experimenting from that starting point.

Thirdly, embracing healthy goals. Whether it's 5-a-day or 30-a-week, accepting the premise that eating a variety of plants is good for you should guide your hand to chuck in extra spices or vegetables that may diverge from whatever your dish's original inspiration was.

# Ideas

I think some relatively simple purchases can set you up with the tools to basically make most home cooking more healthy and/or more delicious.

## Umami

Buy a bottle of soy sauce and go wild. It can enhance anything from chilli, to rice, or pasta sauce, with extra salt, sugar, and meaty flavour. Lee Kum Kee makes a soy sauce with no random bullshit -- just soy beans, water, salt, sugar, and flour. 

MSG is very easy to come by in Asian supermarkets for similar purposes. I also imagine Worcestershire sauce, Oyster sauce etc. will get you to much the same place.

## Extra Virgin

While the price has increased dramatically, I still feel it's worth buying extra virgin olive oil. 

It's such an easy hit of flavour that actively enhances the taste of your other ingredients (and presumably your uptake of any fat-soluble vitamins). I like to cook with it and drizzle over soups or stews.

## America

Onion powder and garlic powder are American staples. Savoury processed food manufacturers love to exploit these and I think the home chef should employ them too. I like to use them even when I use fresh onions and garlic. 

## Veg

Frozen peas or mixed veg can be thrown into basically anything towards the end of cooking to boost flavour, texture, and/or healthiness. Modern flash freezing is an underrated and miraculous thing that people take for granted.

Spring onions are similarly easy to cut up to add to most any savoury dish as a healthy, flavourful garnish. They regrow in water or soil very readily.
