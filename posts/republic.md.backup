Plenty has been written about the sorry state of British republicanism. Even as support for the monarchy [declines](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republicanism_in_the_United_Kingdom#Opinion_polling), most people are, in my experience, quite sheepish about declaring republican beliefs. 

This is not helped by the weakness of republican identity in this country. There are campaign groups -- of debatable efficacy -- but almost no symbols to rally around. 

I admire the effort of the coronation protesters, and it is a disgrace that any of them were arrested. But do the yellow and black ["Not My King" placards](https://twitter.com/novaramedia/status/1654754392329920517) the police seized really stir the soul? 

In contrast, the Union Jack has been visible everywhere this weekend, alongside the crown. You can buy plastic versions imported from China to wave around. You can splash them about on social media. They're easy to work with.

I'm not on Twitter much, but I imagine people haven't been putting the flag of Hungary -- sorry, the British republican tricolour -- in their names or bios. It'd be nothing more than a bad in-joke.

The Scottish, Welsh, and Irish nationalists do not have this problem. Their national flags are recognisable and accessible to people of all political persuasions. In opposition to the British union state, they have an identity.

In opposition to the British monarchy, what do republicans have?
