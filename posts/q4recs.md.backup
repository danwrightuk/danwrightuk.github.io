I wanted to make a very quick note of some of the better things I've read, seen, or listened to in the first few months of 2023 -- especially the new releases. I've tried to limit myself to one recommendation and one honourable mention in each case.

<h1>Film</h1>

Please don't judge me too harshly if you haven't seen it, but <a href=https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/puss_in_boots_the_last_wish>*Puss in Boots: The Last Wish*</a> is my favourite release of the year so far. All of the elements come together brilliantly: vivid animation, fantastic characters, good humour, and a surprisingly mature story that makes it feel like the <a href=https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/logan_2017>*Logan*</a> of the Shrek franchise. I have recommended this film to people before, but I'm not sure how seriously they took that (I am, of course, deadly serious).

It's not a 2023 film, but I'll give an honourable mention to <a href=https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/puss_in_boots_the_last_wish>*The Banshees of Inisherin*</a>. I watched it on a flight to Miami to get me in the Spring Break mood. It's an unflashy but profound film that in any other year would've come away with an Oscar.

<h1>Music</h1>

A new release I've listened to extensively has been Caroline Polachek's *Desire, I Want to Turn Into You*, with 860 minutes streamed so far. I do really like the album, but I'll be curious to see how many tracks I'm still listening to by the year's end...

Of everything else, I think *Miss Anthropocene* by Grimes is most deserving of a mention. It's my most streamed album of the year to date.

<h1>Literature</h1>

The best book I've read this year has been <a href=https://www.orwellfoundation.com/the-orwell-foundation/orwell/books-by-orwell/the-road-to-wigan-pier/>*The Road to Wigan Pier*</a> by George Orwell. I could say a lot more, but suffice to say it's a really compelling read with such relevance to modern Britain (generally for reasons which reflect poorly on our politics and culture).

I have yet to read anything published in 2023, but Lambeth Libraries have kindly agreed to get a copy of <a href=https://www.bloomsbury.com/uk/blazing-world-9781526621672/>*The Blazing World: A New History of Revolutionary England*</a> by Jonathan Healey.

<h1>TV</h1>

Chris Packham's <a href=https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p0bbnh47>*Inside Our Autistic Minds*</a> was wonderful in concept and execution: an autistic presenter platforming autistic people. I've spoken about this show with friends and family, and they all shared my positivity.

I will also give quick mentions to <a href=https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p0dj6ysm>*Fight the Power: How Hip Hop Changed the World*</a> and *The Last of Us*.
