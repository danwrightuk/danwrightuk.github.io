Whether you're a Substack Andy or posting to Instagram, I don't think it's weird to maintain a slightly self-indulgent online presence. The only thing I've done differently is set up a GitHub pages blog instead of a newsletter. 

With that lamp-shading in place: 

[George Orwell](https://www.orwellfoundation.com/the-orwell-foundation/orwell/essays-and-other-works/why-i-write/) once gave four motives for writing, present in every writer in varying proportions:

1. Sheer egoism.
2. Aesthetic enthusiasm.
3. Historical impulse.
4. Political purpose.

About each of these, I'd say:

1. **Sheer egoism**. I could be hit by a bus tomorrow, and I hate the idea that I would have nothing at all on the record. Besides, if I put enough out there, a grief-stricken relative could train an LLM on my online presence and bring me back to virtual life.
2. **Aesthetic enthusiasm**. I think a blog is a good outlet for creativity (the words and their presentation). 
3. **Historical impulse**. In twenty years, I might enjoy looking back on what I wrote for posterity.
4. **Political purpose**. No is reading this, but I'd like to imagine they are and that I'm "pushing the world in a certain direction".
