I wanted to set out my rationale for having a blog. [George Orwell](https://www.orwellfoundation.com/the-orwell-foundation/orwell/essays-and-other-works/why-i-write/) once gave four motives for writing, present in every writer in varying proportions:

1. Sheer egoism.
2. Aesthetic enthusiasm.
3. Historical impulse.
4. Political purpose.

My current motivations are a mix of 1, 2, and 4. In my own words, I would codify them as:

1. By the time I shuffle off this mortal coil, I would like to have some words on the record, regardless of the number of people who substantially care or remember them -- though I obviously hope it will more than zero. A blog is one way to achieve that.
2. The act of writing is enjoyable and something I do daily in far more transient formats (e.g. social media, internal documents). Someone could benefit from reading what I have to say (or at least be dissuaded from posting their own cringe).
3. I want to talk about politics. I found being a Civil Servant fulfilling in many ways -- acts of public service -- but it felt unsuitable for me because I want to discuss politics openly.
