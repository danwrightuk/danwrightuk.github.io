Why do I have this site? While is slightly odd for a nobody like me to have a website, I don't think it's unusual to want some sort of canvas for self-expression.

Besides, this is a very cheap hobby. I use a free GitHub account and a domain name costing all of Â£5.

Regarding the blog specifically, see [Orwell's reasons for writing](https://www.orwellfoundation.com/the-orwell-foundation/orwell/essays-and-other-works/why-i-write/):

1. **Sheer egoism**. It goes without saying.
2. **Aesthetic enthusiasm**. I think a blog is a good outlet for creativity.
3. **Historical impulse**. In twenty years, I might enjoy looking back on what I wrote.
4. **Political purpose**. No is reading this blog, but I'd like to imagine they are.
