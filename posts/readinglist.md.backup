Keep in mind that because I would like to have a job, this is not an exhaustive list of everything I consider worthwhile reading. 

# Utopia and Dystopia

One of my favourite courses at university was the *Politics of the Future* course taught by Prof Duncan Bell. I found a later version of the [course guide](https://www.polis.cam.ac.uk/system/files/pol21_-_politics_of_the_future_2022-23.pdf) which has many great recommendations and puts them in context.

I appreciate these may just as well belong under the sci-fi section.

*Looking Backward*, Edward Bellamy and *News from Nowhere*, William Morris. 

*We*, Yevgeny Zamyatin. 

*A Modern Utopia*, H. G. Wells.

*Nineteen Eighty-Four*, George Orwell.

# Sci-fi and Fantasy

*A Song of Ice and Fire*, George R. R. Martin. Plus the various spin-offs.

*Inheritance Cycle*, Christopher Paolini.

*Metro* series, Dmitry Glukhovsky. The games are good too.

*The Princess Bride*, William Goldman.

*Temeraire* series, Naomi Novik.

*The Illustrated Man*, Ray Bradbury.

*The Martian Chronicles*, Ray Bradbury.

*The Time Machine*, H. G. Wells.

*The War of the Worlds*, H. G. Wells.

*Illidan*, William King.

# Politics

*The Art of War*, Sun Tzu. 

*The History of the Peloponnesian War*, Thucydides.

*Leviathan*, Thomas Hobbes.

*The Putney Debates*. We overlook vast amounts of our democratic/republican history in this country. "The poorest he that is in England hath a life to live as the greatest he."

*The Federalist Papers*. Enjoyable slice of history and examples of the work rate of propagandists like Hamilton. I find this period fascinating and so would also recommend *Common Sense* by Thomas Paine (which was ridiculously popular) and *Conciliation with the Colonies* by Edmund Burke. 

*Reflections on the Revolution in France*, Edmund Burke, and *A Vindication of the Rights of Men*, Mary Wollstonecraft. 

*Declaration of the Rights of Man*, the National Assembly of France; *The Declaration of the Rights of Woman*, Olympe de Gouges; and *A Vindication of the Rights of Women*, Mary Wollstonecraft,

[*Fourth of July Speech*](https://loveman.sdsu.edu/docs/1852FrederickDouglass.pdf), Frederick Douglass. 

*Gettysburg Address*, Abraham Lincoln. Only ~272 words ("the world will little note, nor long remember what we say here...")

*Politics and the English Language*, George Orwell. The six rules if not the whole essay.

[*Can We Survive Technology?*](https://sseh.uchicago.edu/doc/von_Neumann_1955.pdf), John von Neumann. 

# Work

[*Victims of Groupthink*](https://agcommtheory.pbworks.com/f/GroupThink.pdf), Irving Janis. Memorable and relevant to politics and management. The same group of people bottled the Bay of Pigs, but then successfully navigated the Cuban Missile Crisis. Having processes and systems of crisis decision-making that avoid delusional groupthink is a matter of life or death for thousands (war), millions (pandemics) or billions (nuclear engagement) of people.

[Steve Jobs interview on Xerox](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NlBjNmXvqIM). There's a longer clip but this is the core part. Succinct discussion of the effects of product people v marketing people in leadership roles at monopoly technology companies.

*Superforecasting*, Philip Tetlock. 

# Lifestyle

*Ultra-Processed People*, Chris Van Tulleken. Hardly the best evidenced but this book nevertheless reprogrammed my attitude to food in a positive way to focus more on quality.

[*How To Be Successful*](https://blog.samaltman.com/how-to-be-successful) and [*What I Wish Someone Had Told Me*](https://blog.samaltman.com/what-i-wish-someone-had-told-me), Sam Altman. I rarely engage in this Diary of a CEO stuff but these were actually quite interesting.

# Films

It feels impossible to summarise my favourite films and this deserves its own post. Or I could just make a Letterboxd account...

*Blade Runner* (1982) and *Blade Runner 2049* (2017).

*Dune* (2021) and *Dune 2* (2023).

*Inglourious Basterds* (2009).

*Oppenheimer* (2023).

*Dunkirk* (2017).

*The Pianist* (2002).

*Fight Club* (1999).

*The Matrix* (1999).

*The Banshees of Inisherin* (2022).

The *John Wick* series.

*Logan* (2017).

*Dark Knight* trilogy.

*The Batman* (2022).

The *Spiderverse* films.

*Joker* (2019).

*Les MIserables* (2012).

*The Martian* (2015).

*The Holdovers* (2023).

*Poor Things* (2023).

*Starship Troopers* (1997).

*The Truman Show* (1998).

*The Big Short* (2015).

*Star Wars* (TROS is irredeemable).

From the MCU -- which is so nostalgic -- *Infinity War* and *Endgame*, *Thor: Ragnarok*, *Black Panther*, *Civil War*, *No Way Home*.

The *Harry Potter* films. I support trans rights, to be clear...

*Parasite* (2019).

*Moneyball* (2011).
