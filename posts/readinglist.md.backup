I wanted a place to talk about [stuff that I like](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2ZgSg-kc_g). If we have similar interests, you might enjoy something here.

P.S. you can't use any of this for guessing my log-ins.

# Books

It's quite hard for me to really make a good list encompassing all genres. So far, I've listed books in my main nerd fiction genres. 

I find myself profoundly affected by recency bias when trying to think about other specific books to mention. For example, I recently read and loved *Down and Out in Paris and London* by George Orwell. 

It also feels slightly pointless to mention canonical books or the classics. The reading lists at my university are widely accessible.

## Sci-fi and Fantasy

*A Song of Ice and Fire*, George R. R. Martin. Plus the various spin-offs. Unbelievably good.

*Inheritance Cycle*, Christopher Paolini.

*Metro* series, Dmitry Glukhovsky. The games are good too.

*Neuromancer*, William Gibson.

*The Princess Bride*, William Goldman.

*Temeraire* series, Naomi Novik.

*The Illustrated Man*, Ray Bradbury.

*The Martian Chronicles*, Ray Bradbury.

*The Time Machine*, H. G. Wells.

*The War of the Worlds*, H. G. Wells.

*Illidan*, William King.

### Utopia and Dystopia

One of my favourite courses at university was the *Politics of the Future* course taught by Prof Duncan Bell. I found a later version of the [course guide](https://www.polis.cam.ac.uk/system/files/pol21_-_politics_of_the_future_2022-23.pdf) which has many great recommendations and puts them in context.

I appreciate the line between these and some of other books I've named is pretty thin.

*Looking Backward*, Edward Bellamy and *News from Nowhere*, William Morris. 

*We*, Yevgeny Zamyatin. 

*Nineteen Eighty-Four*, George Orwell.

# Films

I still don't have Letterboxd and I don't want to start now. I have an unlimited cinema subscription and see a lot of movies. 

## All-Time

*Pulp Fiction* (1994). *Children of Men* (2006). *Blade Runner* (1982) and *Blade Runner 2049* (2017). *Dune* (2021) and *Dune 2* (2023). The Nolan highlights like *Oppenheimer* (2023) and *Dunkirk* (2017). *Taxi Driver* (1976) and therefore also *Joker* (2019). *The Batman* (2022). *Les Miserables* (2012).

## Honourable Mentions

*Fight Club* (1999). *The Matrix* (1999). The *John Wick* series. *The Truman Show* (1998). *Moneyball* (2011). *Inglourious Basterds* (2009). *Dead Man's Shoes* (2004).

I grew up in the MCU glory days, the highlights including *Infinity War* and *Endgame*, *Thor: Ragnarok*, *Black Panther*, *Civil War*, and *No Way Home*.


## The Recency Bias Honours List

So-named for the recent films that stick out to me.

*The Banshees of Inisherin* (2022). *The Holdovers* (2023). *Poor Things* (2023). *The Substance* (2024). *The Iron Claw* (2024).

# Other

I used to want to flex my professional and intellectual brilliance on here, but that predictably looked super fake. I think these things are digestible and widely applicable enough in life to read for interest anyway.

[*Victims of Groupthink*](https://agcommtheory.pbworks.com/f/GroupThink.pdf), Irving Janis. The same group of people bottled the Bay of Pigs and triumphed in the Cuban Missile Crisis. 

[Steve Jobs interview on Xerox](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NlBjNmXvqIM). Interesting lens to use today with the platform decay of everything.

*Superforecasting*, Philip Tetlock. 

I rarely engage in this Diary of a CEO stuff but these were actually quite interesting: [*How To Be Successful*](https://blog.samaltman.com/how-to-be-successful) and [*What I Wish Someone Had Told Me*](https://blog.samaltman.com/what-i-wish-someone-had-told-me), Sam Altman.
