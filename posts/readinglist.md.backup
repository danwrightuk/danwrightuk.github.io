Here's some books or articles I'd recommend. I can't claim this list is some sort of cohesive narrative, but I'd say all of these have something of merit regardless of political persuasion. I will add to this.

Keep in mind that because I would like to have a job, this is not an exhaustive list of everything I consider worthwhile reading.

# Politics

*The Art of War*, Sun Tzu. 

*The History of the Peloponnesian War*, Thucydides.

*Leviathan*, Thomas Hobbes.

*The Putney Debates*. We overlook vast amounts of our democratic/republican history in this country. "The poorest he that is in England hath a life to live as the greatest he."

*The Federalist Papers*. Enjoyable slice of history and examples of the work rate of propagandists like Hamilton. I find this period fascinating and so would also recommend *Common Sense* by Thomas Paine (which was ridiculously popular) and *Conciliation with the Colonies* by Edmund Burke. 

*Reflections on the Revolution in France*, Edmund Burke, and *A Vindication of the Rights of Men*, Mary Wollstonecraft. 

*Declaration of the Rights of Man*, the National Assembly of France; *The Declaration of the Rights of Woman*, Olympe de Gouges; and *A Vindication of the Rights of Women*, Mary Wollstonecraft,

[*Fourth of July Speech*](https://loveman.sdsu.edu/docs/1852FrederickDouglass.pdf), Frederick Douglass. 

*Gettysburg Address*, Abraham Lincoln. Only ~272 words ("the world will little note, nor long remember what we say here...")

*Politics and the English Language*, George Orwell. The six rules if not the whole essay.

[*Can We Survive Technology?*](https://sseh.uchicago.edu/doc/von_Neumann_1955.pdf), John von Neumann. 

# Governance

[*Victims of Groupthink*](https://agcommtheory.pbworks.com/f/GroupThink.pdf), Irving Janis. Memorable and relevant to politics and management. The same group of people bottled the Bay of Pigs, but then successfully navigated the Cuban Missile Crisis. Having processes and systems of crisis decision-making that avoid delusional groupthink is a matter of life or death for thousands (war), millions (pandemics) or billions (nuclear engagement) of people.

[Steve Jobs interview on Xerox](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NlBjNmXvqIM). There's a longer clip but this is the core part. Succinct discussion of the effects of product people v marketing people in leadership roles at monopoly technology companies.

*Superforecasting*, Philip Tetlock. 

# Sci-fi and Fantasy

I read fiction less than I perhaps should but when I do it's usually  sci-fi or fantasy. 

*Inheritance Cycle*, Christopher Paolini.

*A Song of Ice and Fire*, George R. R. Martin. 

*The Princess Bride*, William Goldman.

*Illidan*, William King.

*The Illustrated Man*, Ray Bradbury.

*The Martian Chronicles*, Ray Bradbury.

*Metro* series, Dmitry Glukhovsky. The games are good too.

*The Time Machine*, H. G. Wells.

*The War of the Worlds*, H. G. Wells.

# Utopia and Dystopia

One of my favourite courses at university was the *Politics of the Future* course taught by Prof Duncan Bell. I found a later version of the [course guide](https://www.polis.cam.ac.uk/system/files/pol21_-_politics_of_the_future_2022-23.pdf) which has many great recommendations and contextualises them for you.

I appreciate these may just as well belong under the sci-fi section of the list.

*Looking Backward*, Edward Bellamy and *News from Nowhere*, William Morris. Two opposing visions at the genesis of a genre.

*We*, Yevgeny Zamyatin. 

*A Modern Utopia*, H. G. Wells.

*Nineteen Eighty-Four*, George Orwell.

# Lifestyle

*Ultra-Processed People*, Chris Van Tulleken. I've seen people question the evidence he uses but this book nevertheless reprogrammed my attitude to food in a positive way.

[*How To Be Successful*](https://blog.samaltman.com/how-to-be-successful) and [*What I Wish Someone Had Told Me*](https://blog.samaltman.com/what-i-wish-someone-had-told-me), Sam Altman.
