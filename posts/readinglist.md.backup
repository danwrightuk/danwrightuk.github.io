Here's some books or articles I'd recommend. I can't claim this list is some sort of cohesive narrative, but I'd say all of these have something of merit regardless of political persuasion. I will add to this.

# Politics

*Leviathan*, Thomas Hobbes. 

*The Putney Debates*. I got a copy in one of the Verso sales. We forget our democratic and republican history in this country. "The poorest he that is in England hath a life to live as the greatest he."

*The Federalist Papers*. Enjoyable piece of history and examples of the work rate of propagandists like Hamilton. I find this period fascinating and so would also recommend *Common Sense* by Thomas Paine (which was ridiculously popular) and *Conciliation with the Colonies* by Edmund Burke. 

*Reflections on the Revolution in France*, Edmund Burke, and *A Vindication of the Rights of Men*, Mary Wollstonecraft. 

*Gettysburg Address*, Abraham Lincoln. Only ~272 words ("the world will little note, nor long remember what we say here...")

*Politics and the English Language*, George Orwell. The six rules if not the whole essay.

[*Can We Survive Technology?*](https://sseh.uchicago.edu/doc/von_Neumann_1955.pdf), John von Neumann. 

# Governance

*Victims of Groupthink*, Irving Janis. Memorable and relevant to politics and management. The same group of people bottled the Bay of Pigs, but then successfully navigated the Cuban Missile Crisis. Having processes and systems of crisis decision-making that avoid delusional groupthink is a matter of life or death for thousands (war), millions (pandemics) or billions (nuclear engagement) of people.

[Steve Jobs interview on Xerox](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NlBjNmXvqIM). There's a longer clip but this is the core part. Succinct discussion of the effects of product people v marketing people in leadership roles at monopoly technology companies.

*Superforecasting*, Philip Tetlock. 

# Lifestyle

*Ultra-Processed People*, Chris Van Tulleken. I've seen people question the evidence he uses but this book nevertheless reprogrammed my attitude to food in a positive way.
