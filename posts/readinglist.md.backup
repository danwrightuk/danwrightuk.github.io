Here's some books or articles I'd recommend. I can't claim this list is some sort of cohesive narrative, but I'd say all of these have something of merit regardless of political persuasion. I will add to this.

# Politics

*Leviathan*, Thomas Hobbes. You get no street cred for putting Hobbes on a list like this because every politics undergrad reads him, but they read him for good reason.

*The Putney Debates*. I got a copy in one of those ridiculous Verso sales. We forget our democratic and republican history in this country. "The poorest he that is in England hath a life to live as the greatest he."

*The Federalist Papers*. Worth reading as both interesting political philosophy and examples of the industry of c18th propagandists, not least Hamilton. I find this period fascinating and so would also recommend *Common Sense* by Thomas Paine (which was ridiculously popular) and *Conciliation with the Colonies* by Edmund Burke. 

*Reflections on the Revolution in France*, Edmund Burke, and *A Vindication of the Rights of Men*, Mary Wollstonecraft. 

*Gettysburg Address*, Abraham Lincoln. Remarkable what you can do with only ~272 words ("the world will little note, nor long remember what we say here...")

*Politics and the English Language*, George Orwell. The six rules are good and usually all you'll see referenced.

[*Can We Survive Technology?*](https://sseh.uchicago.edu/doc/von_Neumann_1955.pdf), John von Neumann. 

# Governance

*Victims of Groupthink*, Irving Janis. The 1971 article captures the main points. Memorable and relevant to politics or management generally. Illustrates how and why the same group in the Kennedy administration botched the Bay of Pigs invasion but saved the world during the Cuban Missile Crisis.

[Steve Jobs interview on Xerox](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NlBjNmXvqIM). There's a longer clip but this is the core part. Succinct discussion of the effects of product people v marketing people in leadership roles at monopoly technology companies.

*Superforecasting*, Philip Tetlock. 

# Lifestyle

*Ultra-Processed People*, Chris Van Tulleken. I've seen people question the evidence he uses but this book nevertheless reprogrammed my attitude to food in a positive way.
