Here's some books or articles I'd recommend. I can't claim this list is some sort of cohesive narrative, but I'd say all of these have something of merit regardless of political persuasion. I will add to this.

# Politics

*Leviathan*, Thomas Hobbes. It is basically a meme at this point in some circles, but this is a classic for a reason. This was the first port of call for my undergrad political theory course and it will deservedly remain at the top of undergrad reading lists for decades to come.

*The Putney Debates*. I got a copy in one of those ridiculous Verso sales. We forget our democratic and republican history in this country too easily. "The poorest he that is in England hath a life to live as the greatest he."

*The Federalist Papers*. Worth reading as both interesting political philosophy and shining examples of the industry of c18th propagandists, not least Hamilton. I find this a fascinating period and so would also recommend *Common Sense* by Thomas Paine, which was sensational at the time, and *Conciliation with the Colonies* by Edmund Burke. Modern constitutional debates (Brexit or Scottish independence) have not led to anything so substantial. 

*Reflections on the Revolution in France*, Edmund Burke, and *A Vindication of the Rights of Men*, Mary Wollstonecraft. 

*Gettysburg Address*, Abraham Lincoln. An exceptional 272 words ("the world will little note, nor long remember what we say here...")

*Politics and the English Language*, George Orwell. At least look at the six rules.

*Can We Survive Technology?*, John von Neumann. It's unfortunate that von Neumann wasn't featured in Oppenheimer but he may have eclipsed the main character. 

# Governance

*Victims of Groupthink*, Irving Janis. The 1971 article captures the main points. Memorable and relevant to politics or management generally. Illustrates how and why the same group in the Kennedy administration botched the Bay of Pigs invasion but saved the world during the Cuban Missile Crisis.

[Steve Jobs interview on Xerox](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NlBjNmXvqIM). There's a longer clip but this is the core part. Succinct discussion of the effects of product people v marketing people in leadership roles at monopoly technology companies.

*Superforecasting*, Philip Tetlock. 

# Lifestyle

*Ultra-Processed People*, Chris Van Tulleken. Very popular book. Reprogrammed my attitude to food in a positive way, reinforcing a desire to eat truly good, nutritious food -- for the right reasons, not vanity.
